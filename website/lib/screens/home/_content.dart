# Welcome to Open Field Language!

The concept of open field (aka knowing field, collective unconscious,
morphic fields, biological fields, developmental fields,
positional fields, morphogenetic fields
or just field here)
was introduced many times by spiritual and therapeutic schools
through centuries.
While the existence of the field is still hypothetical,
the concept is applied in many non-hypothetical practices.

Here, we are declaring terminology of the field theory,
in less hand-waving and more scientific way,
to enable more awareness, discussions and research around it.


The initial version of the terminology is inspired by materials
of the [Open Field School][open-field-school], built on studies
of [Elena Veselago][elena-veselago],
[Bert Hellinger][bert-hellinger], [Rupert Sheldrake][rupert-sheldrake]
and other researchers.

## 1. The field:

    The open field (or just the field here) is one
    more natural element that can move and transfer energy,
    like air, water, fire, light, gravity or electromagnetism.

## 2. The field streams:

    1. There are streams in the field, the same way as in air
    or water.

    2. The field streams move a certain form of energy,
    which can be converted to other forms of energy,
    the same way as water or air streams.

    3. Euclidean distance and material objects do not affect
    the field streams, the same way as light does not
    affect air streams.

## 3. Field and feelings:

    1. The field streams initiate feelings of humans and
    animals, the same way as wind initiates a sailboat movement.

    2. Feelings are not possible without the field streams.

    3. The field streams can transfer qualities, the same way
    as air can transfer scent. The qualities can be described
    as feelings, colors, tastes etc. depending on the context.

    4. Humans and other creatures can influence direction,
    energy and qualities of field streams, the same way as
    rocks and animals can influence water and air streams.

    5. People are connected (or “see” each other or interact)
    through the field, when their attention is directed to
    the same subject.
