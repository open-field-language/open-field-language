# Rules

1. The goal of the project is to reflect community beliefs about the field in the most precise way.

2. Anyone can suggest a change. It will be accepted if there is enough evidence that the community agrees with the change.

3. Topics that are questionable or “foggy” or are not applicable in human practices are not reflected here.

4. If it happens that the community splits into strong groups with conflicting positions, the positions will be reflected as separate branches. For example, we may declare “silver theory” and “nested theory”.

5. This project follows principles of open source software development. The maintainer of the project acts as moderator, with the goal to reflect community opinions in precise clear language.
